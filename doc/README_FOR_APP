I chose to store the API keys in environment variables rather than
facebook.yml. This keeps the information out of the repo while still
allowing deployment to heroku, keeping them more secure. While most friends'
posts showed with basic privs, I noticed that granting read_stream privs gave
access to many more comments so I added this to :scope for the login button.
The interface is a simple AJAX call with an updateable area. While this took
a little longer to implement, I think it makes more sense in this case since
the user may want to quickly skim through his/her friends' stats without
worrying about the browser forward/back button or page reloads.

That said, there are many more things that could be done to improve this app.
Foremost, I'd like to write some more robust Unit tests since facebook data
is such a highly volatile resource. Second, I would add functionality to expand
people in the ranks table, showing their comments. After that I'd probably add
more interesting measurements to rank your friends comments, like perhaps
assigning more weight to recent comments. This app just pulls the most recent
200 and ranks by total count.
